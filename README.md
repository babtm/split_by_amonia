# Split

Developed during flame Game Jam 2022

## Description

The body has lost its soul! The soul has lost its body! Help them to become one again by going back to the location where they got SPLIT. Guide them by using the arrow keys. To switch control between them press ’Q’, and assume control of both with ’W’. But remember: They can’t be too far apart from each other. And hurry, they can’t be away from each other for too long either!

Playable on Github pages:  http://tozu.github.io/split_by_amonia/

itch.io page: https://tozu.itch.io/split

## How it works

- Enable single player movement by pressing [Q]
- Press [Q] again to switch to other player
- Press [W] to (re-)enable syncronous movement
